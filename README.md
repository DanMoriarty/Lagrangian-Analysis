# Lagrangian-Analysis
Animation and analysis of a damped, weighted pendulum scenario

Simple scripted program for the modelling of a state space of a pendulum that is weighted and damped along it's length.
The program also animates the scenario using the MATLAB VideoWriter library and enables easy paramater tuning and modification of simulation settings and variables
